# Mini-Machine-Learning-Projects

This repository was created to keep my personal machine learning projects organized.

## Project 1 : Classification of Iris Flowers
 * Small dataset (150,5)
 * Classification model
 * Comparison of:
	 * Logistic Regression (LR)
	 * Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
	 * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	 * Classification and Regression Trees (CART) 
	 * Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
	 * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
